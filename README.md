# Alternate Da Watch Face Tool

This is a tool for the 'new' MO YOUNG / DA FIT binary watch face files. It allows you to dump (unpack) the files. It can't pack them.

The tool for the older watch face files (pre-'new') is [here](https://github.com/david47k/dawft).

## Building

Run `make` to compile the program using gcc. 

## Supported watches

Da Fit watches using MoYoung v2 firmware and the 'new' watchface API should be supported to some extent.
